# School-Programs
I tend to get carried away after completing an engineering assignment in MATLAB or Python. Some of the time I am adding functionality to existing programs, and other times I'll bring an original thought to life. Here are some of my favorite
* Satelite Simulation
   * Simulates the motion of N number of satellites distributed randomly in Earth orbit
* Metal Beam Simulation
   * Visualizes the deformation results I found by running an Ansys simulation on a metal beam
* Theoretical Displacement
   * Calculates the theoretical force needed for a steel rod to indent a copper surface a certain displacement
 * Spectral Radiation Lab
   * Calculates the intensity of a blackbody emission and plots the results
